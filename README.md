# just
The @stealify/just Runtime Builder using v8 and C Modules to build Ultra Fast Isolates as Native Single Binary from ECMAScript source code.

## Repo Content
- rollup plugins to convert code bases and other usefull code
- build instructions for just-js deps/v8
- just/modules just/libs directly forked into this repository.
- simplyfied just builds.

The Main Reason for this repo is to allow to backport Stealify Development to just. my first plan was to HardFork Just-JS as Example Collection but on the long run i think we could maybe make just-js just work and so make the stealify fork obsolet.
